# chilly-mandrills' Musical Event Finder

## Description

The motivation behind this project is to work collaberatively to create an application that uses existing open server-side APIs to suggest live music events to attend based on the user's musical preference and location. This is a great opportunity to practice working collaberatively with other developers in creating an application that is built on taking advantage of the knowledge and creativity of every group member, as well as practicing fundamental coding skills.
